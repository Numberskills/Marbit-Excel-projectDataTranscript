# Marbit-Excel-projectDataTranscript
Excel add on for transcribing data to PC/PL-files monthly, and automatically creating relations in follow up file.

This Excel add-on has been created as a temporary ad-hoc solution to two manual and laborous activities:
  Creation of relations in the follow-up file
  Setting monthly base data in PL/PC files from financial data files

Scripts intially created by Michael Reinholtz
